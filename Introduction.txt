Materials & Procedures (Osmosis Egg Experiment)


-----
(i)Materials:

Chicken eggs

Solutions: white vinegar, golden syrup, water
-----
Ruler or caliper (for measuring dimensions)

Python 3, pandas, numpy, matplotlib (for calculations and visualization)

#----- 
(ii)Procedures (Computational Focus):

1. Soaked eggs in different solutions for a set period with following order.
    firstly-> raw egg , secondly-> 48 hours for white vinegar ,thirdly-> 48 hours for golden syrup , finally-> 24 hours for water.


2. Measured the eggâ€™s semi-major (a), semi-minor (b), and polar (c) axes each status.

3. Approximated egg volume using the formula:
    V = \frac{4}{3} \pi a b c

#-----
(iii) Data Representation
Calculate volumes for each solution

Compare relative changes due to osmosis

Visualize results using bar charts
